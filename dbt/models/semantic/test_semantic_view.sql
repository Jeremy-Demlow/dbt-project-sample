-- Semantic View Test & Validation Script
-- =============================================================================
-- This script demonstrates proper usage of the customer_intelligence_semantic_view
-- and serves as validation that the semantic view is working correctly.
-- 
-- IMPORTANT: Due to granularity rules, each test must be run separately.
-- Semantic views restrict which dimensions and metrics can be combined.
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 1: Basic customer count (simplest validation)

GRANULARITY RULE EXAMPLES
=============================================================================

-- ‚ùå INVALID: Cannot mix dimensions from different granularity levels
-- This would fail with: "Invalid dimension specified: The dimension entity 
-- 'TICKETS' must be related to and have an equal or lower level of granularity"

SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    {{ var('dbt_cortex_database') }}.{{ var('semantic_schema') }}.customer_intelligence_semantic_view
    DIMENSIONS interaction_type, priority_level  -- Different tables!
    METRICS total_interactions, total_tickets     -- Different granularities!
);

-- ‚úÖ VALID: Same granularity level (customer-level)
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    {{ var('dbt_cortex_database') }}.{{ var('semantic_schema') }}.customer_intelligence_semantic_view
    DIMENSIONS customer_persona, customer_churn_risk
    METRICS total_customers, average_lifetime_value
);

-- ‚úÖ VALID: Same granularity level (interaction-level) 
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    {{ var('dbt_cortex_database') }}.{{ var('semantic_schema') }}.customer_intelligence_semantic_view
    DIMENSIONS interaction_type
    METRICS total_interactions, average_interaction_sentiment
);

=============================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS FOR VALIDATION
=============================================================================

Based on our sample data (1000 customers), you should expect:
- total_customers: 1000
- Customer personas: Mix of "Satisfied", "Frustrated", "Neutral", etc.
- Churn risk levels: "High", "Medium", "Low" 
- Interaction types: "Email", "Phone", "Chat", "Social Media"
- Priority levels: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low"
- Languages: "en", "es", "fr", "de"

If any queries return 0 results, check that the underlying fact tables
have been populated with data.
